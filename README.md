# clothoid-curve-generating-using-camera-frames-and-aruco-markers
This python code allowed me to generate a clothoid curve starting from the position of my camera to the aruco marker position, the curve updates with every movement in order to optimise the distance to travel.
May be camera calibration is needed to emhance the quality of the coordinates and its precision.
